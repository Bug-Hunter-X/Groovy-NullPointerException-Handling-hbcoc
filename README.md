# Groovy NullPointerException Handling

This repository demonstrates a common Groovy coding error related to handling null values and provides a solution.  Improper null handling in Groovy methods can lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors, particularly when a method is not explicitly designed to handle null input gracefully.

The `bug.groovy` file shows the incorrect handling of nulls.  The `bugSolution.groovy` file provides a corrected version.
